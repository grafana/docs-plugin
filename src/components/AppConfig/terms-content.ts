<h2>Context-aware recommendations</h2>
<p><strong>When enabled, contextual data from your Grafana instance will be sent to Grafana's hosted recommendation service to provide personalized documentation recommendations.</strong></p>

<h3>Data collection and usage</h3>
<p>When you enable the recommender feature, the following contextual information may be collected and sent to Grafana's hosted recommendation service:</p>
