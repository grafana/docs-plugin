# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Phase**: Post-Refactoring Optimization & Enhancement
The project has successfully completed a major architectural refactoring and is now focused on:

1. **User Experience Enhancement** - Improving the overall user experience based on the new modular architecture
2. **Interactive Documentation Evolution** - Experimenting with and iterating on dynamic formats for interactive docs
3. **Contextual Recommendation Optimization** - Fine-tuning the recommendation system to be manageable, relevant, and never overwhelming

## Recent Major Accomplishments

### âœ… **Completed: Major Architecture Refactoring (v1.0.2)**
Successfully transformed the codebase from a monolithic structure to a clean, modular architecture:

- **Before**: Single component with ~3,500+ lines mixing UI, business logic, and styling
- **After**: Organized into focused, reusable modules with clear separation of concerns
- **Impact**: Dramatically improved maintainability, testability, and developer experience

**Key Refactoring Achievements**:
- **Hook-Based Architecture**: Extracted business logic into reusable React hooks (`src/utils/*.hook.ts`)
- **Organized Styling**: CSS-in-JS with logical grouping in `src/styles/` directory
- **Centralized Configuration**: Type-safe constants and selectors in `src/constants/`
- **Focused Components**: Clean UI components with single responsibilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Better tree-shaking and code splitting potential

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### **Content Processing Pipeline**
- Dual processing approach (pre and post) provides flexibility for content adaptation
- Multi-strategy content fetching with robust fallback mechanisms
- Interactive elements system using custom events for "show me"/"do it" functionality

### **Recommendation System**
- Context-aware AI-powered recommendations using external ML service
- Smart grouping: Learning journeys vs. standalone docs
- Expandable sections with milestone information for learning journeys
- Real-time context analysis based on user's current Grafana state

### **Tab Management & Persistence**
- Browser-like tab experience with localStorage persistence
- Supports both learning journeys and standalone documentation
- Milestone position preservation across sessions
- Smart content loading on demand

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### **Architecture Patterns**
- **Functional Programming Approach**: Pure functions, immutable data, composed utilities
- **Hook-Based Logic**: Business logic separated from UI rendering
- **Scene-Based State Management**: Leveraging Grafana Scenes for complex state
- **CSS-in-JS with Theming**: Emotion integration with Grafana's design system

### **Code Organization**
- Feature-based modules with clear separation of concerns
- Business logic in `/utils/*.hook.ts` files
- Styling organized by component in `/styles/` directory
- Type-safe configuration in `/constants/` directory

### **Content Strategy**
- Multi-source content fetching with graceful degradation
- Interactive tutorial elements embedded in documentation
- Context-sensitive recommendations based on user state
- Milestone-based progress tracking for learning journeys

## Learnings and Project Insights

### **Refactoring Benefits Realized**
- **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- **Testability**: Individual functions and hooks can be unit tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Hooks and utilities usable across different components  
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and improved runtime performance
- **Developer Experience**: Better IntelliSense, type safety, and code navigation

### **Content Processing Insights**
- Pre and post-processing of content provides maximum flexibility for content adaptation
- Interactive elements system enables sophisticated "show me"/"do it" tutorial functionality
- Multi-strategy fetching handles various documentation source formats gracefully
- Real-time requirement checking enables dynamic tutorial progression

### **User Experience Patterns**
- Context-aware recommendations significantly improve relevance
- Tab persistence enhances user workflow continuity
- Milestone navigation provides clear learning progression
- Expandable sections reduce cognitive overload while preserving access to detail

## Next Steps & Areas for Enhancement

### **Short-term Focus**
- Further refinement of recommendation relevance algorithms
- Enhancement of interactive tutorial element capabilities
- User experience polish based on usage patterns

### **Technical Debt & Opportunities**
- Continued optimization of content caching strategies
- Enhancement of error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and optimization of content loading

### **User-Centered Improvements**
- Feedback collection mechanisms for recommendation quality
- Personalization features based on user learning progress
- Integration of analytics for content effectiveness measurement
