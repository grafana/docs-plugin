# Interactive Elements Requirements System

This document describes the requirements and objectives system for interactive elements in the Grafana Documentation Plugin.

## Overview

Interactive elements in documentation content have a system of requirements that must be satisfied before they can be executed, and a potential system of objectives or goals, that the
tutorials are trying to accomplish.  This document lays all of that out.

1. **Docs Plugin Requirements**: Built-in system rules that govern interactive behavior
2. **Tutorial-Specific Requirements**: Declared in the `data-requirements` attribute by content authors
3. **Tutorial-Specific Objectives**: Declared in `data-objectives` attribute by content authors.

## Docs Plugin Requirements

Docs plugin requirements are automatically enforced by the system and control interactive behavior.
The objective of these requirements are as follows:

1. Make it hard for the user to take confusing or nonsense actions (doing steps out of order)
2. Maximize the chances that the workflow goes smoothly as the user expects
3. Maximize safety: the docs-plugin should not allow you to take a step which can't succeed, as
this creates negative surprise.

## Tutorial-Specific Requirements

Tutorial-specific requirements are declared in the `data-requirements` attribute of interactive elements. Multiple requirements are comma-separated. It is expected that this list will grow 
over time as we have new kinds of interactive tutorials. For example, one tutorial might require
that you have Alloy set up sending data to Grafana Cloud before you can proceed with learning
how the Kubernetes product works; for that tutorial, we'd have to extend data-requirements so that
the docs-plugin could check that condition was true.

### Currently Supported Requirements

#### `exists-reftarget`
- **Purpose**: Ensures the target element exists in the DOM before the interactive action can be executed
- **Usage**: Most common requirement for interactive elements
- **Example**: `data-requirements="exists-reftarget"`

#### `has-plugin:plugin-id`
- **Purpose**: Ensures that a given plugin is installed
- **Usage**: given plugin-id should match Grafana's plugin-id concept, e.g. `volkovlabs-rss-datasource`
- **Example**: `data-requirements="has-plugin:volkovlabs-rss-datasource"`

#### `is-admin`
- **Purpose**: Ensures the current user has Grafana admin privileges
- **Usage**: For interactive elements that require admin access to function properly
- **Example**: `data-requirements="is-admin"`

#### `navmenu-open`
- **Purpose**: Ensures the Grafana navigation menu is open/visible
- **Usage**: For interactive elements that need to interact with navigation menu items
- **Example**: `data-requirements="navmenu-open"`

### Combining Requirements

Multiple requirements can be combined:
```html
<button data-requirements="exists-reftarget,has-datasources,is-admin" 
        data-targetaction="button" 
        data-reftarget="Add Dashboard">
  Click to add dashboard
</button>
```

## Tutorial-Specific Objectives

An objective statement for a tutorial step is a statement of what an interactive step will make
true.  It is expressed in the same language as requirements listed above, but instead, uses the
`data-objectives` attribute in interactive/semantic HTML.

For example, if the purpose of a section is to have the user install the Volkov Labs RSS plugin
so they can get something working with Grafana, then we would state the objective of the step this
way: `data-objectives="has-plugin:volkovlabs-rss-datasource"`.

This is important for multiple different reasons:

1. By knowing what a tutorial is trying to accomplish, we can optionally add extra UI elements
to explain that to the user.
2. State management and completion marking.  Suppose you're doing a tutorial, and you've already
accomplished the first section, resulting in the plugin being installed.  What you'll expect is
that every time you return to the tutorial, that section is marked "finished". The way the system
will accomplish this is by adding "objectives" to requirements checking.  If an interactive step
states an objective, and that objective has already been met, then the step can be marked as 
finished without ever being executed!

Objectives and requirements are kind of opposites of one another.  You cannot execute an
interactive step if a requirement has been met.  And you automatically mark as successfully
done any step whose objective has been met.  In both cases, the functionality blocks or 
prevents execution of a step, but for different reasons.

The syntax of objectives is processed exactly the same as requirements. There may be more than one objective, comma separated just as with requirements. 

The differences in behavior are these:

1. All items whose objectives are met are automatically marked done.
2. If the item is a section, and the objectives are met, this means that all interactive items underneath of the section are marked done. All individual steps within that section should be marked
as complete, AND the section should be marked as complete. This is because sections override or "own"
all of their subordinate steps.
3. Objectives being met does not trigger an error condition. And so: if the objective has been
met, this may shortcut requirements checking for that item.

### Clarifications on the Objectives Feature

Let's consider this example:

```
  <span data-requirements="exists-reftarget,is-admin" 
        data-objectives="has-plugin:volkovlabs-rss-datasource"
        data-targetaction="button">
```

0. Objectives may be missing or empty on any interactive element. In such cases, this means the
objective check always fails, as there is nothing to evaluate.
1. Objectives can be checked at the same time, in parallel with requirements to speed things up.
But if an objective is met, then the output of requirements checking does not matter. If, for example,
in this example case, the `has-plugin` objective is true, then this item would be marked as done,
_even if the user was not an admin_ (i.e. the `is-admin` requirement fails)
2. Objectives always win, and shortcut any error messages or feedback on requirements.
3. If an element specifies multiple objectives, e.g. `data-objectives="has-plugin:foo,has-datasource:bar"`, then ALL objectives must be met. Objective checking is "all or nothing". If any
partial objective is not met, then the objectives are not met.
4. Objective checking should happen continuously during user interaction, and should follow the same
model as requirements checking.  If something is marked done, it doesn't need requirements or objectives
checking. If something is not done, it should be checked. 
5. At this point, live checking of Grafana state is suffient, there is no completion state persistence
that is necessary at this point.
6. Elements that are auto-completed via objectives should show the same green checkmark as manually
completed steps.
7. For sections where objectives are met, all other display stays the same; they will be shown with
completion indicators, and with the same visual and CSS styling as if they'd been completed in the 
usual way.
8. Objectives are a first class part of the InteractiveElementData interface, on par with requirements.
9. (Previous requirement removed)
10. The objective checking system should reuse all check functions (hasPluginCHECK, hasDatasourceCHECK, etc) as requirements. 
11. If an objective check fails due to network or API error, the objective is not met, and the error
is logged to the console.  This does mean that because requirements checking is happening in parallel,
normal requirements handling should still proceed.
12. It is possible to have objectives without requirements.  Requirements gate when an item can be 
executed (no requirements means it can always be executed).  Objectives gate _whether or not it needs
to be executed_.
13. Scope: objectives should be supported for InteractiveSteps, InteractiveSections, and InteractiveMultiSteps.
14. `data-objectives` should be parsed, extracted, and handled as a react component prop exactly the
same as `data-requirements`.
15. Objectives checking should use the same timeout and debounce logic as requirements checking. Ideally
this logic is shared.
16. Parent sections should use direct state management of children for completion marking
17. When objectives are met, the explanation text should simply state: "Already done!"
18. For InteractiveMultiStep, objectives should be checked before executing any internal actions,
as with all other steps. Again as with others, if the InteractiveMultiStep component's objectives 
have been met, all internal actions can be skipped, and marked as completed.

## Disambiguating Requirements and Objectives

1. When both data-requirements and data-objectives exist, we check objectives first, and ignore
requirements if they exist.  
2. If a step 1 has objectives that are met, step 2 is automatically eligible, because it is the
next step (see the "one step at a time" principle)
3. Error state priority: if objective checks fail, and requirements check succeeds, show the 
requirements state (enabled) and log the error to the console.
4. Performance strategy: use smart checking: skip requirements checking if objectives have been
met.  This means check objectives first, requirements second.
5. Always expose the first specific condition that was met or failed. An explanation can be
"Already done!" (objectives met) or "Plugin foo is missing" (requirements failed).
6. For now, the manager does not need to understand the difference between completion types
(manually completed vs. satisifed via objective checking)
7. If an objective becomes met while a user is manually executing a step, continue execution, and
mark complete at the end. Do not interrupt the execution of a step.

## Dual Workflow System

Imagine a tutorial that has multiple sections of instructions. An example might be "create a 
datasource" (5 steps) followed by "configure an alert" (5 steps).  This would be a total of 
10 steps in two discrete sections.

The system supports two types of workflows:

1. **Regular Workflow**: Sequential steps using "Show Me" and "Do It" buttons
   - Follow strict sequential dependency rules
   - Only one step enabled at a time within the workflow
   - Steps must be completed in order

2. **Section Workflows**: Independent workflows using "Do Section" buttons
   - Each "do section" button is its own separate workflow
   - Can be enabled simultaneously with regular workflow steps
   - Function as parent containers for sequences of interactive steps

3. **Multistep Workflows**: These are a hybrid of the two above. For a full
discussion, see `multistepActions.mdc`.

Interactive tutorials can be thought of as a sequence of sections, each section having any
number of discrete actions. **No further nesting is permitted**.  Sections may not contain
sections, only discrete steps/regular workflows.

### Sequential Dependency

**Rule**: Only one step in a regular workflow can be enabled at a time. Later steps are automatically disabled until previous steps complete.

In other words, users are not permitted to skip steps, this easily leads to broken states. If steps
are truly useless, the tutorial's content should change.

**Implementation**:
- Interactive elements are processed in DOM order
- When an element fails its requirements check, all subsequent elements are automatically disabled
- Only the first non-completed element gets requirements checking for performance
- Visual state: `requirements-disabled` class with dimmed appearance

**Example Flow**:
```
Step 1: ✅ Requirements met → Enabled
Step 2: ❌ Requirements failed → Disabled  
Step 3: 🚫 Auto-disabled (previous step failed)
Step 4: 🚫 Auto-disabled (previous step failed)
```

### Completion State

**Rule**: Once an interactive action completes successfully, the entire logical step becomes disabled to prevent re-execution.

We _do not assume that actions are idempotent_. 

**Implementation**:
- Completion is applied to entire logical steps, not individual buttons
- All buttons within the same step (same unique ID) are marked as completed simultaneously
- Completed elements are marked with `data-completed="true"`
- Visual state: `requirements-completed` class with green background and checkmark
- Button text is appended with "✓" to indicate completion

**Step-Level Completion**:
When any button in a logical step is executed:
1. System identifies the step using the button's unique identifier (`data-section-id` or `data-step-id`)
2. All buttons within that step are marked as completed
3. Only buttons with the same unique ID are affected (cross-section isolation)

**Example States**:
```
Before: [Show me] [Do it]
After:  [Show me ✓] [Do it ✓] (both disabled, green background)
```

**Cross-Section Independence**:
```
Section 1: [Save Dashboard ✓] (completed)
Section 2: [Save Dashboard]   (still enabled - different unique ID)
```

### Trust But Verify the First Step

**Rule**: The first step of an interactive workflow is always checked for requirements when no other step has been completed.

**Rationale**: Users need a place to start. This provides a special exception to the sequential dependency rule for the first step only.  Still, requirements checking must be done for every 
element which could be executed, to avoid brokenness. (Clicking a button that cannot work, because
its requirements haven't been met; bad experience).

### Logical Step Grouping

**Concept**: Interactive elements are grouped into logical steps using **unique section/step identifiers** to ensure precise step isolation across different sections.

#### Step Identification System

- **Section Elements**: Elements with `data-section-id` represent "Do Section" buttons that execute entire sequences
  - Use `data-section-id` (e.g., "1", "2", "3") to identify the section
  - Each section button is treated as a separate logical step regardless of content similarity
  
- **Step Elements**: Elements with `data-step-id` represent individual interactive steps within sections
  - Use `data-step-id` (e.g., "1.1", "1.2", "2.1", "2.2") to identify the specific step
  - Format: `{sectionNumber}.{stepNumber}` where section and step numbers increment independently

**To be clear, the specific formatting of step IDs is not important; they need not be formatted
as 1.1, 1.2, etc. The function of these step IDs is to keep a logical flow that a human can
follow by looking at the step IDs, and also to keep steps guaranteed unique from one another.
As such, any "identification scheme" that satisfies these requirements is acceptable.**

These attributes are automatically generated by code and attached when importing tutorial HTML, and are not 
expected to be present in documentation material.

#### Unique Step Keys

The system generates unique identifiers for precise step targeting:
- **Section steps**: `section-{sectionId}` (e.g., "section-1", "section-2")
- **Regular steps**: `step-{stepId}` (e.g., "step-1.1", "step-1.2", "step-2.1")
- **Fallback**: `fallback-{reftarget}|{targetaction}` (for elements without unique IDs)

#### Step Isolation

**Critical**: Steps with identical actions in different sections are completely independent:
- A "Save Dashboard" button in Section 1 (`data-step-id="1.3"`) is separate from a "Save Dashboard" button in Section 2 (`data-step-id="2.3"`)
- Completing one step affects only buttons within the same logical step (same unique ID)
- No cross-section interference or unintended completions

#### Button Grouping Within Steps

Within each logical step, multiple buttons can exist:
- **Show Me** buttons (`data-button-type="show"`) - highlight the target
- **Do It** buttons (`data-button-type="do"`) - execute the action
- **Anchor elements** - direct navigation elements

All buttons within the same logical step share the same unique identifier and are managed as a group.

### Processing Order

The system processes interactive elements using the following order and rules:

#### 1. Element Discovery and Grouping
- All interactive elements in the container are discovered via `[data-requirements]` selector
- Elements are grouped by their unique identifiers (`data-section-id` or `data-step-id`)
- Each group becomes a logical step with one or more buttons

#### 2. Step Classification
- **Regular Steps**: Elements with `data-step-id` that follow sequential dependency rules
- **Section Steps**: Elements with `data-section-id` that operate independently
- **Fallback Steps**: Elements without unique IDs that use legacy `reftarget|targetaction` grouping

#### 3. Sequential Processing (Default Mode)
- **Regular Steps**: Only the first non-completed regular step is eligible for requirements checking
- **Section Steps**: All non-completed section steps are eligible (Trust But Verify principle)
- **Completed Steps**: Fast-disabled without requirements checking for performance
- **Future Steps**: Auto-disabled when previous regular steps fail (One Step at a Time rule)

#### 4. Requirements Checking
- Only eligible steps receive expensive requirements checking
- Completed steps are never eligible for requirements checking, because requirements checking requires resources, and completed steps are not eligible for execution, hence they do not need requirements checking.
- All buttons within a step share the same requirements result
- First button in each step is used as the representative for requirements checking

#### 5. State Application
- Visual states are applied to all buttons within each logical step simultaneously
- Completion state is applied to entire steps, not individual buttons
- Cross-section isolation ensures no interference between similar steps

## Element States

The requirements system manages several visual states:

| Class | Description | Button State | Visual Appearance |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `requirements-checking` | Requirements being validated | Enabled | Loading spinner |
| `requirements-satisfied` | All requirements met | Enabled | Normal appearance |
| `requirements-failed` | Tutorial-specific requirements not met | Disabled | Dimmed, error tooltip |
| `requirements-disabled` | Disabled due to sequential dependency | Disabled | Very dimmed |
| `requirements-completed` | Action already completed | Disabled | Green background, checkmark |

## Technical Implementation

### Event System Architecture

**Unified Event Handling**: The system uses a single, modern event handling architecture:

- **Direct Click Handlers**: Interactive elements use direct click event listeners attached via `attachInteractiveEventListeners()`
- **Requirements Rechecking**: Completion events trigger automatic requirements rechecking via `interactive-action-completed` events
- **Mutation Monitoring**: DOM changes are monitored to detect new interactive content

**Infinite Loop Prevention**:
- **Mutation Observer Filtering**: Only monitors changes to `data-requirements` and `data-reftarget` attributes
- **Interactive Content Detection**: DOM changes only trigger rechecking if actual interactive elements are added/removed
- **Debounced Rechecking**: Multiple rapid changes are batched to prevent excessive processing

### DOM Attributes

#### Core Interactive Attributes
- `data-requirements`: Comma-separated list of tutorial-specific requirements
- `data-targetaction`: Type of action to perform (button, formfill, highlight, sequence, multistep)
- `data-reftarget`: Target element selector or button text to interact with
- `data-targetvalue`: Value to use for formfill actions (optional)
- `data-button-type`: Button type (show, do) to distinguish behavior

#### Unique Identification Attributes
- `data-section-id`: Section identifier for "Do Section" buttons (e.g., "1", "2", "3")
- `data-step-id`: Step identifier for individual steps (e.g., "1.1", "1.2", "2.1")
- **Note**: Elements must have either `data-section-id` OR `data-step-id` for proper isolation

#### State Management Attributes
- `data-completed`: Set to "true" when action is completed
- `data-original-text`: Stores original button text for restoration
- `data-listener-attached`: Marks elements with modern click handlers attached

#### Attribute Inheritance
- Generated buttons inherit the `data-section-id` or `data-step-id` from their parent interactive elements
- This ensures all buttons within a logical step share the same unique identifier
- Fallback elements without unique IDs use legacy `reftarget|targetaction` grouping

### Performance Optimization

When using sequential mode, the system stops checking requirements as soon as one element fails, automatically disabling all subsequent elements. This provides:

- **Performance**: Avoids unnecessary requirement checks
- **User Experience**: Clear indication that previous steps must be completed
- **Logical Flow**: Enforces step-by-step progression

## Usage Examples

### Basic Interactive Element with Unique ID
```html
<span class="interactive" 
      data-targetaction="button" 
      data-reftarget="Save Dashboard" 
      data-requirements="exists-reftarget"
      data-step-id="1.3">
  Click the Save Dashboard button
</span>
```

### Sequential Tutorial Steps with Unique IDs
```html
<!-- Step 1: Will be checked first -->
<span class="interactive" 
      data-requirements="has-datasources" 
      data-targetaction="button" 
      data-reftarget="Add Panel"
      data-step-id="1.1">
  Add a new panel
</span>

<!-- Step 2: Only enabled if Step 1 succeeds -->
<span class="interactive" 
      data-requirements="exists-reftarget" 
      data-targetaction="formfill" 
      data-reftarget="#panel-title" 
      data-targetvalue="My Panel"
      data-step-id="1.2">
  Set panel title
</span>

<!-- Step 3: Only enabled if Step 2 succeeds -->
<span class="interactive" 
      data-requirements="exists-reftarget" 
      data-targetaction="button" 
      data-reftarget="Apply"
      data-step-id="1.3">
  Apply changes
</span>

<!-- Step 4: Requires navigation menu to be open -->
<span class="interactive" 
      data-requirements="navmenu-open,exists-reftarget" 
      data-targetaction="button" 
      data-reftarget="Connections"
      data-step-id="1.4">
  Navigate to Connections
</span>
```

### Multi-Section Tutorial with Step Isolation
```html
<!-- Section 1: Create Dashboard -->
<span class="interactive"
      data-targetaction="sequence"
      data-reftarget="#section-1-steps"
      data-section-id="1">
  Complete dashboard creation
</span>

<span class="interactive" 
      data-targetaction="button" 
      data-reftarget="Save Dashboard" 
      data-requirements="exists-reftarget"
      data-step-id="1.1">
  Save the dashboard
</span>

<!-- Section 2: Configure Alerts -->
<span class="interactive"
      data-targetaction="sequence"
      data-reftarget="#section-2-steps"
      data-section-id="2">
  Complete alert configuration
</span>

<span class="interactive" 
      data-targetaction="button" 
      data-reftarget="Save Dashboard" 
      data-requirements="exists-reftarget"
      data-step-id="2.1">
  Save the dashboard (independent from Section 1)
</span>
```

### Legacy Element (Fallback Support)
```html
<!-- Elements without unique IDs still work but use legacy grouping -->
<span class="interactive" 
      data-targetaction="button" 
      data-reftarget="Save Dashboard" 
      data-requirements="exists-reftarget">
  Click the Save Dashboard button (legacy mode)
</span>
```

## Configuration

### Sequential Mode (Default)
```typescript
await checkAllElementRequirements(container, checkFn, true);
```

### Parallel Mode
```typescript
await checkAllElementRequirements(container, checkFn, false);
```

Sequential mode is recommended for tutorial-style content where step order matters. Parallel mode can be used for independent interactive elements that don't depend on each other.

## Error Handling

### Requirements Checking Errors
- **Unknown Requirements**: Elements with unsupported requirements are marked as failed
- **Requirement Check Errors**: Network or validation errors mark elements as failed
- **Missing Elements**: Elements that can't be found are marked as failed
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues processing other elements when individual checks fail

### Unique ID System Fallbacks
- **Missing Unique IDs**: Elements without `data-section-id` or `data-step-id` trigger warnings
- **Fallback Grouping**: Elements without unique IDs use legacy `reftarget|targetaction` grouping
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing content without unique IDs continues to function
- **Progressive Enhancement**: New content with unique IDs gets improved isolation behavior

### Step Finding Errors
- **Step Not Found**: When completion system can't find a step, it falls back to individual element completion
- **Multiple Fallbacks**: System tries unique ID matching first, then legacy matching if needed
- **Isolation Preservation**: Fallback methods maintain cross-section isolation where possible

## Accessibility

The requirements system includes accessibility features:

- **ARIA Attributes**: `aria-disabled` reflects button state
- **Tooltips**: Disabled buttons show reason via `title` attribute
- **Visual Indicators**: Color and opacity changes provide visual feedback
- **Screen Readers**: State changes are announced through ARIA attributes
