# Product Context

This file serves as:

- Why this project exists
- Problems it solves
- How it should work
- User experience goals

## Why this Project Exists

## Problems it Solves

1. _Discovery of appropriate materials_.  Grafana curates the right/best set of resources for a given topic area,
so that the recommendations in the app simply surface that when needed.
2. _Easy getting started experiences, married with product_.

## How it should Work

The user can open and dismiss the right-hand sidebar tray as desired.

## User Experience Goals

1. Users can quickly find contextual documentation recommendations for what they are looking at in-product
2. Users can receive help on how to navigate the UI and/or have certain compound actions taken for them
3. Users can provide feedback on how the app functions, their level of satisfaction with it, and what's
needed.
