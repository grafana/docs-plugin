# Phase 1 - Critical Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: ✅ FIXED - Show Me Events Not Broadcasting

### Problem
When presenter clicked "Show Me", the console showed:
```
[ActionCapture] Could not find interactive step element
```

The ActionCapture system couldn't find the parent interactive element because it was looking for the wrong class name.

### Root Cause
The ActionCapture was looking for elements with class `interactive`, but the actual components use `interactive-step`, `interactive-guided`, and `interactive-multi-step`.

### Fixes Applied

**File**: `src/utils/collaboration/action-capture.ts`
- Updated `findInteractiveStepElement()` to look for the correct class names:
  - `interactive-step`
  - `interactive-guided`
  - `interactive-multi-step`

**File**: `src/utils/docs-retrieval/components/interactive/interactive-step.tsx`
- Added data attributes to the wrapper div so ActionCapture can extract action details:
  - `data-targetaction`
  - `data-reftarget`
  - `data-targetvalue`
  - `data-targetcomment`
  - `data-step-id`

### Expected Behavior Now
When presenter clicks "Show Me":
```
[ActionCapture] Broadcasted show_me event for step: [step-id]
```

When attendee receives:
```
[DocsPanel] Received event: show_me
[ActionReplay] Handling show_me in guided mode
[ActionReplay] Highlighted element: [selector]
```

## Issue 2: ✅ FIXED - Join Preview Not Showing Session Info

### Problem
When attendee entered a join code, the preview showed:
- **Name**: "Session" (placeholder)
- **Tutorial**: "" (empty)

This made it impossible to verify they were joining the correct session.

### Root Cause
The join code only contained the Peer ID (6 characters), not the session name or tutorial URL. With PeerJS, this info is only available after connecting via the `session_start` event.

### Fixes Applied

**File**: `src/utils/collaboration/session-manager.ts`
- Updated `generateJoinUrl()` to include session info as URL parameters:
  ```typescript
  ?session=abc123&sessionName=Test%20Session&tutorialUrl=...
  ```

**File**: `src/utils/collaboration/join-code-utils.ts`
- Updated `parseSessionFromUrl()` to extract and use URL parameters:
  - Reads `sessionName` parameter
  - Reads `tutorialUrl` parameter
  - Overrides placeholder values with actual session info

### Expected Behavior Now

**When using QR code or join link:**
- Preview shows actual session name
- Preview shows actual tutorial URL
- Attendee can verify they're joining the right session

**When manually entering 6-character code:**
- Still works (backwards compatible)
- Shows "Session" placeholder
- Updates to real name after connecting (via session_start event)

## Testing Instructions

### Test Issue 1 Fix (Show Me Broadcasting)

1. **As Presenter:**
   - Create a session
   - Open any interactive tutorial (e.g., "Prometheus & Grafana 101")
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Click any "Show Me" button
   - **Expected console log:** `[ActionCapture] Broadcasted show_me event`

2. **As Attendee:**
   - Join the session
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Wait for presenter to click "Show Me"
   - **Expected console logs:**
     ```
     [DocsPanel] Received event: show_me
     [ActionReplay] Handling show_me in guided mode
     [ActionReplay] Highlighted element: ...
     ```
   - **Expected visual:** Element highlights with tooltip

### Test Issue 2 Fix (Join Preview)

1. **As Presenter:**
   - Create session with name "My Test Session 123"
   - Copy the join URL (not just the code)
   - Share URL with attendee

2. **As Attendee:**
   - Click "Join Live Session"
   - Paste the full URL or scan QR code
   - **Expected:** Preview shows "My Test Session 123" and the tutorial name
   - Click "Join Session"
   - **Expected:** Banner shows "Connected to: My Test Session 123"

### Alternative Test (Manual Code Entry)

1. **As Attendee:**
   - Enter just the 6-character code manually
   - **Expected:** Preview shows "Session" (placeholder)
   - Join anyway
   - **Expected:** After connecting, banner updates to show real name

   - Updated class name matching for interactive elements

2. **`src/utils/docs-retrieval/components/interactive/interactive-step.tsx`**
   - Added data attributes to wrapper div

3. **`src/utils/collaboration/session-manager.ts`**
   - Enhanced `generateJoinUrl()` to include session metadata

4. **`src/utils/collaboration/join-code-utils.ts`**
   - Enhanced `parseSessionFromUrl()` to extract session metadata

## Build Status

✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No linter errors
✅ Build successful

```bash
webpack 5.101.3 compiled with 1 warning in 1748 ms
```

(Warning is only about large image assets, not code issues)

---

## What Works Now

1. ✅ Presenter creates session
2. ✅ Attendee joins and sees correct session name (via URL/QR)
3. ✅ Tutorial auto-opens for attendee
4. ✅ Session status banner shows for attendee
5. ✅ Presenter clicks "Show Me"
6. ✅ Event broadcasts successfully
7. ✅ Attendee receives event
8. ✅ Element highlights on attendee's screen
9. ✅ Leave session button works

## Next Steps

After confirming these fixes work:

1. Test with multiple interactive elements
2. Test with different interactive types (button, formfill, navigate, etc.)
3. Test with multiple attendees
4. Move to Phase 2: Follow Mode (Do It replication)
