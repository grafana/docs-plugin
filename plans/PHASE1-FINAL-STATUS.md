# Phase 1 MVP - Final Status & Testing Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Session Name Now Shows in Join Preview

**What was fixed:**
- `AttendeeJoin.tsx` now detects if you paste a full URL and extracts query parameters
- Supports both manual code entry (6 chars) and full URL paste
- QR codes and join links now include `sessionName` and `tutorialUrl` parameters

**How to test:**
1. Create session with name "Test Workshop 2024"
2. Copy the join URL from PresenterControls
3. Paste the full URL into the join code field
4. **Expected:** Preview shows "Test Workshop 2024" and the tutorial URL

### 2. Show Me Events Now Broadcasting

**What was fixed:**
- ActionCapture now looks for correct class names: `interactive-step`, `interactive-guided`, `interactive-multi-step`
- InteractiveStep component now renders data attributes on the wrapper div
- Highlights display correctly on attendee screens

**How to test:**
1. Presenter clicks "Show Me"
2. **Expected console (presenter):** `[ActionCapture] Broadcasted show_me event for step: ...`
3. **Expected console (attendee):** `[ActionReplay] Highlighted element: ...`
4. **Expected visual (attendee):** Orange pulsing border around element with tooltip

## 🎯 Interactive Guide Behavior (By Design)

### How It Works

**Guided Mode** is designed for **demonstrative learning** where:
- **Presenter** clicks "Show Me" → **Attendee** sees highlight
- **Presenter** clicks "Do It" → **Attendee** sees highlight only (doesn't execute)
- **Attendee** can follow along manually by clicking/filling elements themselves
- **Interactive step completion happens independently on each screen**

### Why Steps Don't Auto-Complete for Attendees

This is **intentional behavior**:

1. **Different Tutorial States**: Presenter and attendee may be at different steps
2. **Individual Progress**: Each person should complete steps at their own pace
3. **Learning by Doing**: Attendees learn better by actually performing actions themselves

### Expected Workflow

```
Presenter                          Attendee
────────────────────────          ────────────────────────
Opens tutorial                    Opens same tutorial (auto-opens when joining)
Clicks step 1 "Show Me"    →      Sees step 1 highlighted
                                  Clicks the highlighted element
                                  Step 1 marks as complete ✓
                                  
Clicks step 2 "Show Me"    →      Sees step 2 highlighted
                                  Fills in the form field
                                  Step 2 marks as complete ✓
```

### Important Notes

1. **Tutorial Must Be Open**: Attendee needs the tutorial open for step completion to work
   - ✅ Auto-opens when joining session
   - ✅ Opens the correct tutorial from session config
   
2. **Steps Complete Independently**: Each person progresses through the tutorial independently
   - Presenter might be on step 5
   - Attendee might be on step 2
   - Both can see highlights from presenter's "Show Me" clicks
   
3. **Highlight Doesn't Block Interaction**: The orange border has `pointer-events: none`
   - You can click through it
   - You can type in form fields
   - It's purely visual guidance

## 🔧 Testing Checklist

### Setup
- [✅] Two browser windows (regular + incognito, or two different browsers)
- [✅] Both windows: Navigate to Grafana → Pathfinder panel
- [✅] Both windows: Open browser console (F12)

### Test 1: Session Creation & Joining

**Presenter Window:**
- [✅] Click "Start Live Session"
- [✅] Enter session name: "Test Workshop 2024"
- [✅] Click "Create Session"
PROBLEM: WITHOUT A TUTORIAL OPEN HERE, TUTORIAL IS BLANK
- [✅] Verify: Session Active button appears
- [✅] Copy join URL (not just the 6-char code)

**Attendee Window:**
- [✅] Click "Join Live Session"
- [✅] Paste the full URL
- [✅] **Verify:** Preview shows "Test Workshop 2024"
- [❌] **Verify:** Preview shows tutorial URL (NO TUTORIAL BECAUSE PRESENTER WASN'T ON ONE)
- [✅] Select "Guided" mode
- [✅] Click "Join Session"
- [✅] **Verify:** Green banner shows "Connected to: Test Workshop 2024"
- [❌] **Verify:** Tutorial auto-opens in new tab

### Test 2: Show Me Highlighting

**Presenter Window:**
- [✅] In the auto-opened tutorial, scroll to any interactive step
- [✅] Click "Show Me" button
- [✅] **Console:** `[ActionCapture] Broadcasted show_me event`

**Attendee Window:**
- [❌] **Console:** `[DocsPanel] Received event: show_me`
- [❌] **Console:** `[ActionReplay] Highlighted element: ...`
- [✅] **Visual:** Orange pulsing border appears around element
- [✅] **Visual:** Tooltip with comment appears

PROBLEM: Nothing in the console on presenter or attendee browser!

PROBLEM: 

### Test 3: Interactive Guide Completion

**Attendee Window:**
- [✅] With highlight visible, click the highlighted element (or fill form, etc.)
- [❌] **Verify:** The step marks as complete (green checkmark)
- [❌] **Verify:** Interactive guide advances to next step
- [✅] Scroll to next step
- [✅] Wait for presenter to click "Show Me" on step 2
- [✅] **Verify:** Highlight appears on step 2 element
- [✅] Perform the action (click/fill/navigate)
- [❌] **Verify:** Step 2 marks as complete

PROBLEM: Step not marked as complete when manually actioned (clicked). There is a PR open for auto step completion detection so lets ignore this for now.

### Test 4: Multiple Attendees

- [ ] Join with a third browser window
- [ ] **Verify:** Presenter sees attendee count increase
- [ ] **Verify:** Both attendees see same highlights
- [ ] **Verify:** Each attendee's progress is independent

NOT PERFORMED FOR NOW.


ADDITIONAL PROBLEM: If attendee leaves session and tries to join again, the Join session button opens the model with the previous session details visible and the join button is disabled with "joining...". If you press "back" button and enter a new code you see the correct session details but joining button is still disabled and shows joining... so you can't actually join a new session.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### 1. Manual Code Entry Shows Placeholder

**Symptom**: If you type just the 6-character code (not the URL), preview shows "Session"

**Why**: The 6-char code is just the Peer ID - doesn't contain session name

**Workaround**: Use the full URL (QR code or copy link button)

**Will be fixed**: After connection, the banner updates to show real name via `session_start` event

### 2. Tutorial Must Be at Same Position

**Symptom**: Highlight appears but element not in view

**Why**: Presenter and attendee might be scrolled to different positions

**Workaround**: Attendee should navigate to same section as presenter

**Future enhancement**: Auto-scroll attendee to highlighted element

### 3. Different Tutorial Versions

**Symptom**: Selector doesn't find element

**Why**: Presenter and attendee might have different tutorial versions

**Workaround**: Ensure both are using same Grafana version
