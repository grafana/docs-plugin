# Experimental Feature Labels - Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Added clear "Experimental" labels to the live sessions feature configuration page to set proper admin expectations about stability and reliability. User-facing UI remains clean and professional.

## Changes Made

### 1. Plugin Configuration Page
**File**: `src/components/AppConfig/ConfigurationForm.tsx`

#### Section Title
- Changed: "Live Sessions (Collaborative Learning)"
- To: **"Live Sessions (Collaborative Learning) ‚Äî Experimental"**

#### Toggle Label
- Added "(Experimental)" to the switch label

#### When Enabled - Warning Alert
Added prominent warning at the top:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Feature

This feature is experimental and may have stability issues. Connection reliability depends on
network configuration and the availability of the PeerJS cloud service. Not recommended for 
production-critical workflows.
```

#### When Enabled - Info Alert
Enhanced technical note:
```
Technical Note: This feature uses peer-to-peer connections via PeerJS cloud signaling.
Connection reliability may vary. If you experience connection issues, try refreshing or ask 
your administrator to consider running a dedicated PeerJS server.
```

#### When Disabled - Warning Alert
Updated to emphasize experimental nature:
```
Experimental feature disabled

Live sessions are currently disabled. This is an experimental feature that enables collaborative 
learning experiences where presenters can guide attendees through interactive tutorials in real-time.

Note: This feature uses peer-to-peer connections and may have stability issues depending on network
configuration. Enable only if you understand the limitations and have tested it in your environment.
```

### 2. User-Facing UI
**Files**: `docs-panel.tsx`, `PresenterControls.tsx`, `AttendeeJoin.tsx`

#### Design Decision: Keep It Clean
- **No "Beta" labels on buttons** - Clean professional appearance
- **No warnings in modals** - Streamlined user experience
- **No experimental disclaimers in UI** - Admin already knows from config

**Rationale**: 
- Admin makes the decision to enable via config (where warnings exist)
- End users should have a clean, professional experience
- Experimental warnings in config are sufficient gatekeeping

## Visual Hierarchy

### üî¥ Critical Warnings (Admin Config Only)
When enabled in config, shows **yellow warning alert** emphasizing:
- Experimental status
- Potential stability issues
- Not recommended for production-critical workflows

### ‚úÖ Clean User-Facing UI
- No beta labels
- No experimental warnings
- Professional, streamlined experience
- Admin has already made the informed decision

## User Communication Strategy

### For Administrators
**Message**: This is experimental, may have issues, test before deploying

**Where**: 
- Plugin configuration page (primary decision point)
- Disabled by default
- Multiple alerts explaining risks
- Technical notes about P2P limitations

### For End Users
**Message**: None needed - clean experience

**Rationale**:
- Admin already vetted and enabled the feature
- No need to bombard users with warnings
- Professional appearance builds confidence
- If issues arise, admin knows it's experimental

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Manages Admin Expectations**: Admins make informed decision with full context

‚úÖ **Professional User Experience**: Clean UI without constant warnings

‚úÖ **Reduces Support Burden**: Admins know to expect issues, can warn their users if needed

‚úÖ **Legal Protection**: Clear disclosure to admins who control the feature

‚úÖ **Balanced Approach**: Warning where it matters (config), clean where it doesn't (usage)

‚úÖ **Builds Confidence**: Users trust a polished interface more than one covered in warnings

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `src/components/AppConfig/ConfigurationForm.tsx` - Config page labels and warnings
- ‚úÖ `src/components/docs-panel/docs-panel.tsx` - Button labels and tooltips
- ‚úÖ `src/components/LiveSession/PresenterControls.tsx` - Modal title and warning
- ‚úÖ `src/components/LiveSession/AttendeeJoin.tsx` - Modal title and warning

## Build Status
‚úÖ Clean build with no errors

## Recommendation

This labeling strategy provides the right balance:

1. **Admin sees comprehensive warnings** in config before enabling
2. **Users get clean, professional experience** without warning fatigue
3. **Admin is the gatekeeper** - they make the informed decision

This single-layer approach ensures admins understand the risks while giving end users confidence in the feature. The admin controls access, so they can communicate limitations to their users as needed. Clean and professional! üéØ
